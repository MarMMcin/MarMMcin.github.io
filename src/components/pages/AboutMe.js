        I'm front-end web developer from Rzeszów.<br></br> At the high school’s
        IT classes I have created my first web design which developed my
        interest and passion to build websites. After high school graduation I
        have undertaken an university course in spatial planning to follow my
        hobbies. After university graduation, I have returned to the front-end
        web design and built several new positions in completely different
        technologies.
